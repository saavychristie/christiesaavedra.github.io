## 📝 ABOUT SECTION

### Version 1: Narrative (Recommended)

I've been doing instructional design before I knew what instructional design was.

I've designed state-approved curriculum for a trade school serving at-risk youth, secured a $200,000 grant for an industry-education partnership, automated healthcare billing systems for a Medicaid mental health agency, and built technology operations that serve 500+ students daily.

The common thread? I build systems that help people learn, adapt, and succeed.

My approach combines boots-on-the-ground operations experience with formal UX and instructional design training. I don't just create training—I understand the business processes, the stakeholder dynamics, and the change management required to make adoption actually happen.

Currently completing my Bachelor's at UCF (December 2025) and beginning my Master's in Instructional Design and Technology (January 2026)—bringing 20+ years of hands-on experience into formal practice.

**What I do:**
→ Change Management & Technology Adoption
→ Instructional Design & Curriculum Development
→ UX Design & Healthcare Technology
→ Training Program Development & Facilitation

**What makes me different:**
I've been on both sides—as the person implementing new systems AND as the person convincing skeptical staff to actually use them. That dual perspective shapes everything I design.

### Version 2: Concise & Punchy

20+ years building systems that help people learn and adapt to change.

From founding a state-approved trade school → automating healthcare operations for a Medicaid agency → securing $200K in state grants for workforce development → designing UX solutions for healthcare dashboards.

I don't just create training materials. I understand the business processes, map the stakeholder dynamics, and design the change management strategy to make adoption actually stick.

Currently: UCF Bachelor's (Dec 2025), Master's in Instructional Design starting Jan 2026.

Core expertise:
• Change Management & Adoption Strategy
• Instructional Design & Curriculum Development
• UX Design & Prototyping (Figma, React)
• Healthcare Technology & Compliance
