## Do These FIRST (Biggest Impact)

### 1. Update Your Headline (2 min)
Change from job title to value statement:

**COPY THIS:**
```
Change Management & Instructional Design | Helping Organizations Adopt Technology Through Training & Human-Centered Design
```

### 2. Replace Your About Section (5 min)
**COPY THIS:**

```
I've been doing instructional design before I knew what instructional design was.

I've designed state-approved curriculum for a trade school serving at-risk youth, secured a $200,000 grant for an industry-education partnership, automated healthcare billing systems for a Medicaid mental health agency, and built technology operations that serve 500+ students daily.

The common thread? I build systems that help people learn, adapt, and succeed.

My approach combines boots-on-the-ground operations experience with formal UX and instructional design training. I don't just create training—I understand the business processes, the stakeholder dynamics, and the change management required to make adoption actually happen.

Currently completing my Bachelor's at UCF (December 2025) and beginning my Master's in Instructional Design and Technology (January 2026)—bringing 20+ years of hands-on experience into formal practice.

What I do:
→ Change Management & Technology Adoption
→ Instructional Design & Curriculum Development
→ UX Design & Healthcare Technology
→ Training Program Development & Facilitation
