```

**Example for Acme Corp UX Designer role via LinkedIn:**
```
https://christiesaavedra.com/ux-designer.html?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=job-application&utm_campaign=acme-corp-ux-designer-dec2024

| **Sessions by Campaign** | Which companies are viewing your portfolio |
| **Engagement Time** | How long they spend reading |
| **Pages per Session** | How much they explore |
| **Return Visitors** | Companies coming back (strong interest!) |
